# IV.Project2DFX-PreCE

Project2DFX adds LOD corona effect to a game map, making LOD-world look a lot better. 

This repository is only for GTA IV, see other games [here](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/III.VC.SA.IV.Project2DFX/).

This fork re-utilizes the old pre-CE code by ThirteenAG (from v4.3) into the new code (v4.4+) made for CE and FusionFix. Some manual work was done, but not much. The corona size and brightness may also not be ideal, as I couldn't get one address that the math relies on.
